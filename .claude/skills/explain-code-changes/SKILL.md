description: Explains code changes with visual diagrams and analogies. Use when explaining how code works, teaching about a codebase, or when the user asks "how does this work?"

When explaining code changes, always:

- First try doing a git-diff with the main branches and analyzing the changes.

1. **Draw a diagram**: For complex changes in the process flows, Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships of the changes.
2. **Walk through the code**: Explain step-by-step what happens, Use simple terms to make it easier to understand the changes.
3. **Highlight a gotcha**: What's a common mistake or misconception?

Keep explanations conversational. For complex concepts, use multiple analogies.
