## Why a blog?

Building things is only half the work. Writing about them forces clarity — you have to understand something well enough to explain it. This blog is a place to document projects, share ideas, and think out loud.

## What to expect

A mix of topics:

- **Web development** — frameworks, patterns, performance
- **Creative coding** — shaders, generative art, WebGL
- **Tools and workflows** — things that make development faster

## A code example

Here's a simple Astro component for reference:

```astro
---
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
---

<h1>{greeting}</h1>
```

And some TypeScript:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## What's next

More posts, more projects. Stay tuned. There's a lot that needs to be added for this blog thing to work.
